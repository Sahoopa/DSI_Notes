# Git Workflows
* Single Remote Workflows
  - Centralised - Remote only has master and create a pull request against the master
  - Feature branch - PR against feature branch
    (+) more isolation
    (-) bit too flexible
  - GitFlow - master tracks/stores the official releases
    - "dev" branch to integrate standalone features
      - standalone feature branch

# Rebasing
 - Do locally (so before you share with the team)
 - Orders your commits from various sub branches
