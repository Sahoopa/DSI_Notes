# Modelling Techniques

There are two main branches of statistical learning:

1. Supervised learning
  1. Regression - target variable is continuous
    * [Linear Regressions](linear_regression.md)
      * Use MSE to calculate the error rate
  2. Classifications - target variable is discrete
    * [KNN](KNN_K-Nearest_Neighbours.md)
      * Use Accuracy as main measure - see [Confusion Matrix](confusion_matrix.md)
    * [Logistic Regression](logistic_regression.md)


2. Unsupervised learning
  1. Clustering
  2. Anomly detection

* Other Topics
  * [Bias - Variance trade off](bias_variance.md)
  * [Feature Scaling](feature_scaling.md)
  * [Regularization](regularization.md)
  * [Train Test Split](train_test_split.md)
  * [Gradient Descent](gradient_descent.md)
  * [Grid Search](grid_search.md)
